## Neural Network for Recognizing Handwritten Digits - Binary Classification

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook project focuses on building a neural network using Keras to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project includes steps for loading and visualizing the dataset, constructing a sequential model with several dense layers, and training this model on the MNIST training data. It also involves validating the model's performance on a test set. The architecture of the model and the training process are both visualized and assessed using accuracy plots for the training and validation datasets.
